## 2026-07-02 (scheduled scan)

Searched arXiv (cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.MA) and the web for new agent-memory papers, focused on the last ~3 days (2026-06-29 to 2026-07-02), with two clearly relevant papers included just outside that window (2026-06-25, 2026-06-27). 6 new papers confirmed and added.

**Security (2):**
- Always-On Agents: A Survey of Persistent Memory, State, and Governance in LLM Agents (2606.30306) — 2026-06-29
- Agents That Know Too Much: A Data-Centric Survey of Privacy in LLM Agents (2606.26627) — 2026-06-25

**Optimization (4):**
- Mandol: An Agglomerative Agent Memory System for Long-Term Conversations (2606.29778) — 2026-06-29
- Neural Procedural Memory: Empowering LLM Agents with Implicit Activation Steering (2606.29824) — 2026-06-29
- What Memory Do GUI Agents Really Need? From Passive Records to Active Task-Driving States (2606.31612) — 2026-06-30
- HyphaeDB: A Living Knowledge Topology for Agent-First Memory (2606.28781) — 2026-06-27

**Near-misses considered and excluded:**
- MemDelta: Controlled Baselines and Hidden Confounds in Agent Memory Evaluation (2606.29914, 2026-06-29) — benchmarking-methodology critique, not itself an attack or optimization technique.
- Analytic Concept-Centric Memory for Agentic Embodied Manipulation (2606.29774, 2026-06-29) — robotics/embodied-manipulation memory, different subfield from textual/RAG agent memory security or optimization.
- DMV-Bench: Diagnosing Long-Horizon Multimodal Agents' Visual Memory with Incidental Cue Injection (2606.27499, 2026-06-25) — visual-memory retention robustness benchmark, not a privacy/poisoning attack or a compression/efficiency method.
- CogniFold: Always-On Proactive Memory via Cognitive Folding (2605.13438, latest revision 2026-06-17) — outside the recency window.
- Governed Shared Memory for Multi-Agent LLM Systems (2606.24535, 2026-06-23) and Forget to Improve (2606.25115, 2026-06-23) — relevant but outside the recency window; left for a future run if still novel then.

## 2026-07-02 (user-submitted, single paper)

- Opal: Private Memory for Personal AI (2604.02522) — confirmed on-topic, ORAM-style trusted-enclave memory for agentic systems combining privacy and efficiency gains.

## 2026-07-02 (user-submitted batch)

User submitted 6 candidates to verify; 5 confirmed and added, 1 skipped as off-topic.

**Security (4):**
- ADAM: A Systematic Data Extraction Attack on Agent Memory via Adaptive Querying (2604.09747)
- Governing Evolving Memory in LLM Agents / SSGM (2603.11768)
- Beyond Similarity: Trustworthy Memory Search for Personal AI Agents / MemGate (2606.06054)
- Unveiling Privacy Risks in LLM Agent Memory / MEXTRA (2502.13172)

**Optimization (1, flagged as adjacent infra):**
- Onyx: Cost-Efficient Disk-Oblivious ANN Search (2604.20401) — general oblivious ANN search, not agent-specific; included at user's request as retrieval infra relevant to vector-backed agent memory.

**Skipped:**
- USENIX Security '25 "Found in Translation: A Generative Language Modeling Approach to Memory Access Pattern Attacks" (jia-grace) — about OS-level memory-paging side-channel attacks, not LLM agent memory. Keyword-collision false positive.

## 2026-07-02 (manual seed run)
